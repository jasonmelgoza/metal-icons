# Metal Icons

A flexible set of icons built for React.

---

## Basic Usage

All icons are available as individual React components.

First, install `metal-icons` from npm:

```bash
yarn add metal-icons
```

Now, you can import each icon individually as a React component:

```JavaScript
import { Folder } from 'metal-icons'

function Button() {
  return (
    <button>
      <Folder />
      <span>Add Folder</span>
    </button>
  )
}
```
